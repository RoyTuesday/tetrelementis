# Tetrelementis

### *A Tetris clone about learning the Chemical Elements*

## Setup

**Easy method:** I keep my most up-to-date, stable version of the game on my personal website [here!](http://roytuesday.github.io/projects/index.html)

**Download:** If you want to keep a copy on your own computer instead of visiting my site (and why don't you want to visit my site?), keep reading.

1. Clone the repo to your Desktop or whatever directory in which you want to keep it.
2. Use your favorite browser to open 'index.html' in the 'app' directory
3. Follow the in-game instructions to begin!

## Development
While first learning JavaScript, but before learning Git workflow, I spent some extra time building a Tetris clone in the browser. Early on, I decided to distinguish my version by assigning a chemical element to each Tetris block (or 'tetrinimo'). After several weeks, I had a functional, if clunky, game with a twist of Chemistry.

The more I learned about JavaScript, the more I realized my resulting game needed a total rehaul. Rather than start a new Git repository with no history of my work (or worse, continuing to work _without_ Git) I resolved to start over!
